# MyApplication

### App Description
With MyApplication, you can change the text of a main display message by pressing the, "Change Text" button. If you would like to show a personalized message, feel free to add your own text into the text box before pressing the "Change Text" button. You can also change the color of that message and change the color of the background screen with the other two buttons. To reset the application to its original display settings, simply tap anywhere on the background screen. You can leave good feedback by clocking the checkbox in the lower right corner! If you check this box without meaning to, it can be unselected... ):
